## Continuous Improvement Plan

Consistent with the Agile development approach, moja global aims to operate in a framework for continuous improvement.

This means that improvement of moja global processes, specifically about the development of software and documentation of that software, should be incremental, rather than relying upon large resource intensive reviews to make big leaps of improvement.

## Kaizen

The Kaizen approach to continuous improvement involves improvement through many incremental improvements. The responsibility for the process sits with all people involved and is therefore not one that is specifically led by managers (maintainers, senior contributors, steering committees and more), but should be supported by managers.

In this spirit, continuous improvement is the responsibility of all involved. This should include:

1.  Reflecting on processes to see if improvements could be made for efficiency or quality
2.  Proposing identified improvements, by raising them with others in the project including peers, maintainers or other senior people working on the project.
3.  Continually reflecting on your work practices to see if there are ways that you can improve.

Where improvements result in the refinements to processes, these should be documented. Documentation should occur as improvements to existing guidance eg. [How-to guides](https://github.com/moja-global/About-moja-global/tree/master/Contributing), or if no guidance exists, new guidance documentation should be developed.

## Periodic Review

While moja global operates under a framework of continuous improvement, it is expected that the high-level strategy for moja global will also benefit from targeted periodic reviews. It is proposed that the periodic reviews will take place as part of the annual strategic plan development for moja global.

The aim will not be to conduct a complete review of moja global activities, but rather to focus on selected high-level issues. The strategy board and technical steering committee will be jointly responsible for identifying issues to review.
