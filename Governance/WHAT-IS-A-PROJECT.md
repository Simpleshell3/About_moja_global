## What is a Project?

A project is a discrete piece of work related to the development of code, such as a module or a feature along with the documentation in association with the project. A project requires the contribution of more than 1 person. To smoothen collaboration, some [practical steps](../Contributing/How-to-Start-a-New-Project.md) is proposed here for those who wish to collaborate on a project.

## Types of Projects

There are two types of projects:

1.  **Strategy Initiated**: Every year moja global develops a [strategic plan](STRATEGIC-PLANS.md). The strategic plan consists of several projects. Anybody can [propose ideas for the strategic plan](../Contributing/How-to-Provide-Strategic-Advice.md). The Strategy Board prioritises and approves the plan and [mobilizes the necessary resources](../Contributing/How-to-Assist-with-Fundraising.md) for the implementation. We love to have contributors [join these projects](../Contributing/How-to-Join-moja-global.md) in association with moja global and make necessary impact.

2.  **User Initiated:** As a user, you can start a project that is important to you. You can [submit a project idea](../Contributing/How-to-Start-a-New-Project.md) at a time that suits your convenience. The idea of the project might come from your own need/preference or it might be an issue that was already listed on the issue backlog of a repository but requires contributions. In either case, thank you for [starting a new moja global project](../Contributing/How-to-Start-a-New-Project.md).
