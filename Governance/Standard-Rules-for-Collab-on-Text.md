Moja global uses Google Docs to collaborate on text documents as more people are comfortable with the format.

The following rules can be pasted at the beginning of the document to facilitate collaboration:

This is an open-source document. Everybody is welcome to contribute. To allow us to be efficient, we have only few rules:

1. All contributors use comments to ask questions or make substantial and structural suggestions. Always suggest solutions in your comments and not in problems.
1. Only Maintainers can resolve comments.
1. All contributors make edits in “[suggesting mode](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8B0HaLk0_s)” (even if you are a maintainer or editor, so the other maintainers or editors can cross-check and accept your contribution).
1. Write suggested edits directly into the text in "[suggesting mode](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8B0HaLk0_s)". Do not use comments to suggest edits.
1. Only Editors assigned to the document can approve edits
1. Spelling will be UK English
1. Referencing Style is Harvard (author-date) type. Tools such as [Zotero](https://www.zotero.org/) may be useful.
