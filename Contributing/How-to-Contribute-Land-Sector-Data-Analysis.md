# Moja Global Land Sector Data Analysis Guide

## 1.0 Introduction

This document aims to guide contributors to report the analysis of 

[Moja Global's Land Sector Dataset](https://datasets.mojaglobal.workers.dev/0:/).<br> 

---

### 1.0.0 The Land Sector Dataset
The dataset is a collection of publicly available [Open source datasets](https://github.com/moja-global/Land_Sector_Datasets), which you can choose any and work on. 

- Many countries/regions use this dataset and it works well in real global scenarios. For each data set, information about content and licenses is provided. Appropriate permissions are cited for all datasets, and we urge you to follow the license before continuing to use each dataset.

If you have another dataset on your mind that would be beneficial to [Moja Global's mission](https://moja.global/), feel free to reach out to us at [info@moja.global](info@moja.global) to share details about this dataset.

---

### 1.0.1 Data Analysis Software and Notebooks

Notebooks are documents produced by the data analysis software, which contain both computer code (e.g. python) and rich text elements (paragraph, equations, figures, links, etcâ€¦). 
>Notebook documents are both human-readable documents containing the analysis description and executable code which can be run to perform data analysis. 

Select software that supports geospatial analysis. 
- Moja Global is an open-source project, and the interest here is to share your process (code) and results (explanation) to support the open-source movement. To effectively record your analysis, we recommend that you use a [notebook](https://sourceforge.net/software/product/Google-Colab/alternatives).

### 1.0.2 Contributing

When your contribution is ready; raise a PR to have it merged. Refer to the [community website](https://community.moja.global/community/code-contribution) to know how to make a pull request.

>If you have experience and want to help, send an email to [mentorship@moja.global](mailto:mentorship@moja.global). We are open to mentoring new developers and contributors through various mentorship programs and initiatives.

### 1.0.3 The Analysis

When we look at climate action, we would like to get descriptions from a global scale to a specific state administration within a particular country. A draft review of the characteristics of each file in the dataset is found [here](https://github.com/Simpleshell3/Land-Sector-Dataset-Description/blob/main/Land-Sector-Dataset-Description.md).

Amongst the numerous factors that affect climate change, the Agriculture, Forestry, and Other Land Use (AFOLU) sector is responsible for almost a quarter of the global Greenhouse gases (GHG) emissions. The emissions associated with AFOLU activities are projected to increase in the future.


The following sections guide you on how to document your analysis at any scale (global, continental, country, state).
