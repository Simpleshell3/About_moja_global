## Document Code:

Documentation acquires utmost necessity in Software development to ensure that everyone is on the same page. With documentation, you can ensure that the code base remains accessible and understandable in the longer run. It would also allow coaches and ambassadors to onboard new contributors quickly, as documentation provides a quick start to the whole project. We have five levels of documentation at moja global which we employ to document our code:

1.  Documentation in the code base: 

    -   Before commenting in the code try to clarify the code [with better naming and structuring](https://medium.com/@andrewgoldis/how-to-document-source-code-responsibly-2b2f303aa525). 
    -   Use comments to provide context to the reader of the code.
    -   Ensure comments are easy to maintain and understand.

2.  Documentation in Markdown files:

    -   Use Markdown files for documentation that needs to be reviewed by maintainers before it is changed. It includes:
        -   How-To information
        -   Plans 
        -   Procedures
        -   Governance documents
    -   Submit changes using a pull-request which would be reviewed and merged.

3.  Documentation in the repository Wiki:

    -   Use the repository Wiki for information that can be changed by all collaborators without review, including:
        -   Tutorials
        -   Explanations
        -   Reference Information
    -   Make changes and commit directly to the Wiki.

4.  Documentation in Google Docs:

    -   Use Google Docs for the collaborative development of documents (text equivalent of features branches), including:
        -   Science Designs
        -   Architecture 
        -   Strategy
    -   Make changes in accordance with the [guidelines provided in the document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1feo9G91bbjth9RZ4606Rag4tAdRxuYpfnlWecs-gbbY/edit?usp=sharing).

5.  Documentation in PDF files
    -   Use PDF-files for documentation that should not be changed (text equivalent of a release), including:
        -   Science Designs
        -   Architecture
        -   Strategy
        -   Meeting notes
    -   Errors can be pointed out to the document maintainer. All other changes can only be made in the next version which is still open in Google Docs.
