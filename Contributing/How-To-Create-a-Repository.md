## Create a Repository:

A repository contains all the files and the revision history associated with a project under development. moja global uses repositories to store files, revision history, carry out discussions, manage the project work and accept contributions from our diverse contributors. To get started with creating a repository, please follow these steps: 

1.  If you are a member of the moja global organization, define a new repository: 

    -   Use a short version of your title as the repository name: `moja-global/repository-name`.
    -   Use the full title as the description of the repository.
    -   Make the repository public.
    -   Initialize it with a `README` file which includes the abstract of the project.
    -   Create your repository.

2.  If you are not a member of the moja global organization, the moja global team will create the repository for you and invite you as an external member to take charge of the project. Follow these steps:
    -   Navigate to the `.github` repository.
    -   Click Issues.
    -   Click the green button **Get Started** in the Feature Request box.
    -   Use the title of your project as the title of the requested features.
    -   In the body of the Issue, provide the abstract of your project first. Then follow the template to the extent it is useful and provide as much information as possible.
    -   Attach files, screenshots and/or animated GIFs
    -   Click the green button "Submit New Issue" at the bottom right corner.
    -   If you have not received a reply within 2 days, please write us at [tsc@moja.global](mailto:tsc@moja.global).
