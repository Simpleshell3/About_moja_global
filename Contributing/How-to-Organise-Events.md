## Organise Events:

Events are important to reach out to new users or improve collaboration. At moja global we are increasingly looking to a diverse group of contributors. Please have a look at the following steps to help us organize events:

1.  If you are organising an event or would like to assist with other events, please send an email to .
2.  Use a clear and descriptive title.
3.  Please provide background or references to prove your good intentions if you do not have a track record on GitHub.
4.  Attach files, screenshots and/or animated GIFs to illustrate your ideas
5.  Please allow a few days for moja global to reply.
