## Translations

moja global wants to reach as many people as possible including those who do not speak English well. This is our approach to translations:  

1.  User Interface

    -   Please contact the Maintainer of the User Interface Repository.
    -   More information will be made available when the User Interface further advances.

2.  Wiki and user info

    -   moja global wants all info to be available in all languages BUT maintaining information across various languages is hard and time-consuming.  
    -   Please use the `Translate` function available through your browser to translate pages on GitHub or the Website.  
    -   Please advise on how we can facilitate contributions from those who are not comfortable with English.

If you have experience and want to help, please send an email to [mentorship@moja.global](mailto:mentorship@moja.global).
