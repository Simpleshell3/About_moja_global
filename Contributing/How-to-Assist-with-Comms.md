## Contribute to Communication and Outreach:

moja global supports new contributors and people willing to help simplify our processes and workflow. If you would like to help us with communication and outreach tasks, please have a look at the following points to get started:

2.  If you have experience and want to help, please send us an email at [info@moja.global](mailto:info@moja.global). 
3.  Use a clear and descriptive title.
4.  Please provide background or references to prove your good intentions if you do not have a track record on GitHub.
5.  Attach files, screenshots and/or animated GIFs to illustrate your ideas and plans.
6.  Please allow a few days for **moja global** to reply
