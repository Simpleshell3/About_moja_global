# User-interface (UI) working group

Hello and welcome. This document outlines all the information about the User-interface (UI) working group. For any queries about the UI working group, please reach out to us on [Slack](https://join.slack.com/t/mojaglobal/shared_invite/zt-o6ta1ug0-rVLjAo460~d7JbZ~HpFFtw).

## What’s a working group?

A working group is a group of people working together to achieve set goals. The groups are domain-specific and focus on discussion or activity around a specific subject area.

## What is the goal of this working group?

We are trying to follow a “sprint-like” structure. In each “sprint” cycle we start with planning and then work towards the goals defined in that plan. We keep track of the ongoing sprint using GitHub issues. You can stay up to date on the ongoing and upcoming work by:

 - Attending our online meetings.
 - Reading our meeting agendas.
 - Reviewing the list of GitHub issues under the relevant repositories.
 - Reaching out to us on Slack.

**The UI working group aims to accomplish the following in the coming days:**

- **TSC working group notice board**. - There are several active and incubating working groups at moja global. We want to establish and develop a TSC working group noticeboard. For more information, see GitHub issues - [Set up TSC Working group notice board](https://github.com/moja-global/Google.Season.of.Documentation/issues/12).

- **Community website** - The Community website aims to show an overview of moja global's projects and how they work to the wider community. The website hosts projects, case studies, blogs, tutorials, and more developed by the wider moja community to help people better understand our work. It’s currently under development and all contributions towards improving the project are welcome. With the help of the UI working group, we would like to make UI components for the community website, improve accessibility and usability, design new pages, and document UI development workflow. For more information, see GitHub repository - [Community website](https://github.com/moja-global/community-website). If you feel stuck, chat with us on the [#community-website](https://app.slack.com/client/T1G1M5HPF/C022V91MY0M) channel on Slack.

- **FLINT-UI** - The FLINT-UI is a web-based user interface for FLINT, used to configure simulations with the FLINT.Cloud APIs, and run workflows in the browser itself. The FLINT-UI is a new project and all contributions towards making it better are welcome. For more information, see GitHub repository - [FLINT-UI](https://github.com/moja-global/FLINT-UI).

- **Reporting tool**. - The role of the reporting tool is to provide business intelligence by analyzing the FLINT output database and converting it into into useful graphics and charts. The current implementation of the reporting tool treats the Flux database as a simplified 2006 GL reporting table. We hope to refactor Angular components to be compatible with 13.x, add new features to the reporting tool, refactor old code, and fix UI errors. If you want to contribute to the reporting tool, you can browse the issues in the GitHub repository - [FLINT.Reporting](https://github.com/moja-global/FLINT.Reporting). If you need help, chat with us on the [#reporting-tool](https://app.slack.com/client/T1G1M5HPF/C016YNZ2ALX) channel of Slack.

**Note:** The sprint goal may change from time to time. Please have a look at the pinned message in the #user-interface channel in our Slack to find the goal for the ongoing sprint.

## Tools and technologies

The tools and techniques used vary from project to project. The most commonly employed are:

 - [React](https://reactjs.org/)
 - [Angular](https://angular.io/)
 - [Vue](https://vuejs.org/)
 - [Sphinx](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/)
 - [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)
 - [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/)
 
 By browsing through the relevant repositories, you can learn more about which technologies are used where. Please note, to be able to contribute it's not necessary for you to be familiar with these technologies from the start.

## How can I get involved?

- If you are interested in getting involved in this working group, there is a weekly meeting that takes place every Saturday at 10:30 (GMT) / 16:00  (IST) / 5:30 (EST). Feel free to stop by then (or any time!) to introduce yourself or send a message in the [#user-interface](https://app.slack.com/client/T1G1M5HPF/C010Z37GL2U) channel of our Slack.
- If you’re interested in contributing, there is no need to wait for the meeting! As a part of the UI working group, there is an abundance of things available to work on. We value all kinds of contributions, not just code.
- We are particularly motivated to support new contributors and people who are looking to learn and develop their skills. Setting up the projects, trying them out, reporting bugs, working on good first issues, and helping us build a stronger community are great ways to get started.
- If working with GitHub seems like magic to you or you aren’t clear about the steps, look at our [GitHub Workflow](https://docs.moja.global/en/latest/DeveloperWorkflow/index.html) documentation. If you need any help, let us know. The community is more than happy to help you out.
- moja global’s projects are community-driven and your help is extremely welcome. If you get stuck, please don’t hesitate to chat with us on Slack or raise an issue.
